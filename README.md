![headers_fraud-prev](images/headers_fraud-prev.jpg)

As a university student deeply curious about the hidden stories data can tell, I dove into this project fueled by my passion for data analysis and a strong desire to make a difference. I'm always on the lookout for opportunities where I can apply my skills in meaningful ways, and this challenge to ensure the safety of credit card transactions caught my full attention. With an ambition to help this company be recognized as the safest credit card provider, I embraced the task of minimizing missed fraud cases. My apporach was thoughtful yet cautions, aiming to flag suspicious transactoins even at the risk of encountering some false positives. This project isn't just an adcademic exercise for me; it's about real-world impact, protecting people, and learning immensely along the way.

# How I Approached the Analysis

1. Diving into the data 
    I plunged into a vast ocean of over 550,000 transactions, where only a tiny fraction - 0.4% were fradulent. My task was to sift through various transaction attributes, such as categories, amounts, times, and locations, to detect underlying patterns of fraud.
2. Crafting New Tools 
    Realizing the need for sharper tools in my arsenal, I engineered new features that could capture subtle signs of fraud. These included patterns in the timing of transactions, geographical treds, and identifying particularly risky transaction categories.
3. Uncovering the Patterns of Deceit 
    My investigations revealed that the witching hours of between 10 PM and 3 AM were prime times for fraudsters, particularly in the realm of online shopping, and transactions above $500 bore the highest risk.
4. Mapping the Fraud Landscape 
    A closer look at the geography of fraud showed an intriguing pattern: despite fewer transactions, New York emerged as the fraud capital with the highest percentage of fraud cases, surpassing even Texas, which had the highest volume of transactions but a lower proportion of fraud.

# Insights and Storylines from the data

The late-night transactions, especially at 10 PM, were the peak hours for fraudsters to strike.

The virtual marketplace, particularly high-ticket items, turned out to be their preferred hunting ground.

New York, with its bustling, diverse environment, presented the highest risk and thus the focal point of our preventative strategies.

# Drawing Conclusions and Looking Forward 

This narrative isn't just about numbers; it's about understanding and preempting human behavior to project our customers. The patterns I've unveiled through this data tell us where to watch more closely and how to sharpen our defenses. My recommendations?

1. Highten monitoring during the high-risk nocturnal hours.
2. Tighten checks for transactions that scream 'high-ticket'.
3. Focus the company's strategic efforts on regions like New York that are prone to fraud.

This tale of data and detection has set the stage for future endeavors to develop even more sophisticated tools to combat fraud, ensuring safety and integrity within the realms the company operates.
